  "Title": "Drones and Possibilities of Their Using",
  "Abstract": "The article discusses the construction and possibilities of using drones. It covers topics such as the construction of drones, including the frame, propellers, engine, system of power, the electronic control, and communication system. It also compares military and civilian drones, outlining their size and drive differences. Furthermore, it highlights the possibilities of using drones in various sectors such as public services, army, industry, photography, filming, and delivering shipments. The article also addresses the risks associated with drone usage, focusing on the fall of drones, battery discharge, weather conditions, and privacy concerns. Additionally, it mentions ongoing projects related to the development of power for drones, such as graphene batteries, pure lithium anodes, and fuel cells.",
